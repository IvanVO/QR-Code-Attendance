# QR-Code-Attendance

## Description
This project serves as an extension for a teacher's app provided by a university. In this extension, professors will not only be able to see the courses they are teaching, but a QR code will be generated in each class so the teacher can take attendance of the class.

This QR code is generated only when time and day there is a class and it gets deleted when the class is over.
